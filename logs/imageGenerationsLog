Tools – list three tools (MUMBL 🎙️, WRITER ✍️, MUSE 🧠) that open special creative interfaces. 2. Projects – collapsible section, includes “+ New Project” and 3–4 saved projects. 3. Songs – dynamic list similar to chat history, with a “+ New Song” button at the top.  Design should use a dark mode aesthetic, SF Pro or similar font, soft shadows, clean spacing, and minimalist icons. Structure and feel should closely mimic the ChatGPT mobile app's sidebar.   ⸻ redesign your sidebar in the style of ChatGPT, but tailored to your music creation flow.  ⸻  ✅ Mimic Sidebar Layout (Apple/ChatGPT Style)  🧱 STRUCTURE  ───────────────────────────── 🔍 Search  🛠️ Tools • MUMBL  • WRITER  • MUSE   📁 Projects • + New Project • MUSE 2.0 • PROMPT MASTER • BAES STUFF • 10 more ⌄  🎵 Songs • “+ New Song” • Lost in Tokyo • Untitled Beat • Midnight Loops  ───────────────────────────── 👤 ayo omoloja   ⸻  ✨ DESIGN NOTES  🔍 Search 	•	Keep same position and styling — rounded field, subtle shadow. 	•	Use to filter songs, tools, and projects.  🛠 Tools Section  Like GPTs but renamed. Each tool can: 	•	Open a new workspace or floating tool pane. 	•	Be assigned a distinct icon: 	•	MUMBL = 🎙️ (Auto-humming / melody gen) 	•	WRITER = ✍️ (Lyrics editor/assistant) 	•	MUSE = 🧠 (File/project organizer)  📁 Projects 	•	Use collapsible folders like “My GPTs.” 	•	“+ New Project” stays on top. 	•	Each item acts like a project board (multi-song container).  🎵 Songs 	•	Individual sessions like chat threads. 	•	“+ New Song” starts a new writing session. 	•	Title, small preview, or last opened timestamp (if needed).  ⸻  It should look almost identical to the screenshots structure , with a smooth slide in animation    "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/3EDDD546-9D88-46E5-94E6-BCC7887BBF4A.jpg\n\n[2025-07-22T16:19:49.755Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: " And redo the home page to look like this   "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/B2E0AA1E-042B-4D85-B7A5-8C7FC28197EE.jpg\n\n[2025-07-22T16:42:45.470Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "When you click create song section , this modal should pop up before opening the Lyric pad"\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/45B97306-C540-4311-BE6A-A1EDD5CEB2BB.jpg\n\n[2025-07-23T14:06:58.353Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "Instead of the home, make a small hamburger menu that opens a sidebar on the left .

This modal should only appear when the user swipes up from the bottom of the screen (or when manually toggled). Do not modify the Recorder component itself — just display it inside the modal.  ⸻  🧩 Modal Behavior: 	•	Triggered by swipe-up gesture or a toggle state from Zustand (isRecordingModalVisible). 	•	Dismisses by: 	•	Swiping down 	•	Tapping outside modal 	•	Updating Zustand: toggleRecordingModal(false)  🎙️ Inside the Modal: 	•	Render the existing <Recorder /> component (including mic button, timer, waveform, etc.). 	•	Center the Recorder vertically within the modal.  💅 Modal Styling (match LYRIQ system): 	•	Background color: #2A2A2A 	•	Top corners: borderTopLeftRadius: 24, borderTopRightRadius: 24 	•	Top padding: 20px, horizontal padding: 16px 	•	Drag handle: small horizontal bar at the top (width: 40px, height: 5px, background: #666, borderRadius: 2.5px) 	•	Dimmed overlay: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) when modal is open 	•	Match dark mode design system (#1A1A1A bg, system font, rounded corners, subtle shadow)  ⚙️ Architecture: 	•	Use react-native-reanimated v3 and react-native-gesture-handler to animate slide-up modal. 	•	Modal should mount with animated spring slide from bottom. 	•	Manage modal visibility in Zustand: const { isRecordingModalVisible, toggleRecordingModal } = useLyricStore();  	•	Lazy load modal component using dynamic import (performance optimization)  🛠 Optional Add-ons: 	•	Auto-dismiss keyboard when modal opens 	•	Add vibration feedback or pulsing animation to mic icon (non-critical) "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/97CA0D39-AE3B-49D4-AE98-BB6A2964F1E4.jpg\n\n
